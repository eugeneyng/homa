## Introduction

Homa is an open-source web and mobile application to organize and record your interactions with your home/house. We call it a PHM, or Personal Home Management, System. Think of it as a [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) (a popular tool used by sales teams in the corporate world) for your houses. This is what it currently looks like:

### Purpose

Homa allows people to keep track of everything that’s important about their home. Like the maintenance associated with the house. When you last swept the chimney. It will help you remember what color paint is in each room. It can also remind you to clean and mow the lawn.

### Features

* Management of houses
* Management of appliances
* Management of tasks
* Reminders
* Basic journal
* Upload documents and photos
* Ability to define custom rooms
* Multiple users

### Who is it for?

This project is **for people who have difficulty remembering details about their house**. You might be a homeowner who owns a single property or a property manager with multiple properties.  

### What Homa isn’t

 * Homa is not a smart assistant. It won’t guess what you want to do. It’s actually pretty dumb: it will only send you emails for the things you asked to be reminded of.
 * Homa is not a tool that will scan your data and do nasty things with it. It’s your data, your server, do whatever you want with it. You’re in control of your data.

## Get started

There are multiple ways of getting started with Homa:

1. You can use [our Hosted version]().  This is the simplest way to use Homa.
2. You can install it on your own server by following the [installation instructions here](/docs/installation/readme.md). There are no limitations on Homa if you install it on your own server.

    - The downloadable version will always be the most complete version – the same as offered on the paid plan on the Hosted version.
    - Self-hosted will always be completely free with no strings attached and you will be in complete control.

### Requirements

If you want to host Homa yourself, you will need a server with:

- Docker

## Contribute

Do you want to help? That’s awesome. We welcome contributions of all kinds from everyone.

Here are some of the things you can do to help.

## Principles, vision, goals and strategy

We want to use technology in a way that does not harm human relationships, like big social networks can do.

### Principles

Homa has a few principles.

- It should be simple to use, simple to contribute to, simple to understand, extremely simple to maintain.

- It is not and never will be ad-supported.

- Users are not and never will be tracked.

- It should be transparent.

- It should be open-source.

- It should do one thing (documenting home interactions) extremely well, and nothing more.

- It should be well documented.

### Vision

Homa’s vision is to **help people have more control over their home**.

### Goals

We want to provide a platform that is:

- **really easy to use**: we value simplicity over anything else.

- **open-source**: we believe everyone should be able to contribute to this tool, and see for themselves that nothing nasty is done behind the scenes that would go against the best interests of the users. We also want to leverage the community to build attractive features and do things that would not be possible otherwise.

- **easy to contribute to**: we want to keep the codebase as simple as possible. This has two big advantages: anyone can contribute, and it’s easily maintainable on the long run.

- **available everywhere**: Homa should be able to run on any desktop OS or mobile phone easily. This will be made possible by making sure the tool is easily installable by anyone who wants to either contribute or host the platform themselves.

### Strategy/Growth

We think Homa has to become a platform more than an application, so people can build on it.

Here what we should do in order to realize our vision:

- Be the central point of home management

- Build great reports so people can have interesting insights on how they interact with their home.

### Monetization

While it’s not the driving force behind Homa, it would be great if the tool could generate money so we could work full time on it and sustain it on the long run. We are big fans of Wordpress, Monica, and GitLab, and we believe this kind of business model is an inspiring one where everyone wins.

If you want to support the development of Homa, consider taking [a paid account](https://www.homa.com/pricing), or support us [on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/homa).

- The [Hosted version of Homa](https://homa.com) is offered in two versions:

    * a [free plan](https://app.homa.com/register) which includes:
        + 1 home
        + ads
        + email reminders

    * a [paid plan](https://www.homa.com/pricing) which includes:
        + unlimited homes
        + advanced features

    * We’re still working on the features included in the paid plan, and these may be subject to change while we work out our business model to make Homa’s development sustainable.

    * People who substantially contribute to the GitHub repository (with a pull request that adds value, that gets merged – not a typo fix, for instance) will also have access to the paid version for free.

- There is a [Patreon account](https://www.patreon.com/homa) for those who want to financially support Homa’s development in another way. The best way to support Homa it is to actually talk about it and help grow its userbase.

We will never resell your data on [the Hosted version](https://homa.com/) and we have no access to it if you self-host.

We are like you, and this is why we are on GitHub: we hate big corporations that do not have at heart the best interests of their users, even if they say otherwise. We believe that the only way to sustain the development of Homa is to actually make money in a good old-fashioned way.

### Why Open Source?

Why is Homa open source? Is it risky? Will someone steal my code and do a for-profit business that will kill my own business? Why reveal my strategy to the world? These are the kind of questions we’ve received by email already.

The answer to these questions is simple: yes, you can fork Homa and make a competing project, make money out of it (even if the license is not super friendly towards that) and I’ll never know. But it’s okay, I don’t mind.

I wanted to open source Homa for several reasons:

- **I believe that this tool can really change people’s lives.**  
    While I aim to make money out of it, I also want everyone to benefit from it. Open sourcing a project like this will help Homa become much bigger than what I imagine myself. While I strongly believe that this software has to follow the vision I have for it, I need to be humble enough to know that ideas come from everywhere, and people have much better ideas than what I can have.

- **You can’t make something great alone.**  
    While Homa could become a company and hire a bunch of super smart people to work on it, you can’t beat the manpower of an entire community. Open sourcing the product means bugs will be fixed faster, features will be developed faster, and more importantly, developers will be able to contribute to a tool that positively changes their own lives and the lives of other people.

- **Doing things in a transparent way leads to formidable things.**  
    People respect the project more when they can see how it’s being worked on. You can’t hide nasty things in the code. You can’t do things behind the backs of your users. Doing everything in the open is a major driving force that motivates you to keep doing what’s right.

- **Once you’ve created a community of passionate developers around your project, you’ve won.**  
    Because developers are very powerful influencers. Developers will create apps around your product, talk about it on forums, and share the project with their friends, families, and colleagues. Cherish the developers – users will follow.
